                      Assignment #4: Splay Trees
                        (Due date: 11/14/2025) 


Your program implements the splay tree data structure for the dictionary
abstract data type. 


Initially the program reads data from "in.dat", and establishes an
ordinary binary search tree by inserting the data into the tree. The data
file contains integers, one per line.


Then the program starts an interactive mode. The commands are as follows.

   S 1000 - splay the tree at 1000
   F 2000 - search/find the node with key 2000
   I 3000 - insert a node with key 3000
   D 4000 - delete the node with key 4000


For each command, 

1. Report appropriate message after the command is executed. Examples are:

   Splay is done
   Search is successful
   Search is unsuccessful
   The key is inserted into the tree
   Duplicated keys
   The key is deleted from the tree
   The key is not in the tree

2. Display the new tree.
